Website Audit Analysis – Applied Animal Science  
Introduction  
The Applied Animal Science website is designed as a resource for college students aiming for careers in animal care, veterinary assistance, and agricultural science. These expanding fields require individuals who possess both theoretical understanding and practical experience. The website's purpose is to educate students about available courses, career paths, and essential skills, presenting this information in a clear, engaging, and user-friendly format.  
The program equips students for positions in veterinary clinics, animal shelters, livestock management, and agricultural enterprises. The website's design, functionality, and user-friendliness are vital for attracting potential students. Features such as functional buttons, engaging visuals, intuitive navigation, and interactive elements (like hover effects and motion graphics) significantly enhance the user experience.  
As the site auditor, my responsibility was to assess the website's functionality, usability, design, and technical performance. The audit aimed to ensure that these aspects align with project objectives and meet user expectations.

Findings and Observations  
Throughout the audit, I evaluated each element for functionality and user experience. The buttons and hover effects functioned effectively on desktop, providing a dynamic method to present additional information. The motion graphics were smooth and pertinent, contributing a modern touch without overwhelming the interface.  
The website’s navigation is intuitive, guiding users seamlessly through course details and career options. Headings, subheadings, and clear labels improve usability. However, incorporating accessibility features such as keyboard navigation and support for screen readers would enhance inclusivity.  
In terms of design, the site’s simplicity and appeal are noteworthy. The images of animals are attractive and relevant, and the gentle color palette fosters a welcoming environment. Nevertheless, certain sections could benefit from more context or captions to clarify images and graphics.
